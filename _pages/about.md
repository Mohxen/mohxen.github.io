<!-- # About Me -->
<!-- <div style="text-align: justify;"> -->
I am a Computer Engineering Ph.D. candidate at Polytechnique Montréal with a strong background in Machine Learning, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, and Computer Networks. I have expertise in various programming and hardware description languages, including C, C++, C#, SQL, Python, VHDL, and Verilog. My research is focused on enhancing P4 programming language and compiler.

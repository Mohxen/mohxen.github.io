# About Me
I am a Computer Engineering Ph.D. candidate at Polytechnique Montréal with a strong background in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, and Computer Networks. I have expertise in various programming languages and hardware description languages, including C, C++, C#, SQL, Python, VHDL, and Verilog. My research is focused on enhancing P4 language constructs, transitioning P4 code to different intermediate representations, and implementing heterogeneous compilers.

## Education
- **PhD Candidate in Computer Engineering**  
  *Polytechnique Montréal, Canada*  
  May 2022 - Present

- **MSc in Computer Engineering**  
  *Shahid Beheshti University (SBU), Iran*  
  Sept 2018 - Sept 2021

- **BSc in Computer Engineering**  
  *Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) and Semnan University, Iran*  
  Sept 2012 - Jan 2017

## Work Experience
- **Research Assistant**  
  *Polytechnique Montréal, Canada*  
  Apr 2021 - Present  
  - Enhanced P4 language constructs for network devices using LEX, YACC, and IR classes in C/C++ and Python.
  - Transitioned P4 code/IR to CUDA, MLIR, and LLVM’s IR for a heterogeneous compiler implemented on RISC-V.
  - Developed a complete object-oriented compiler with lexer, parser, symbol table, semantic analyzer, AST, and code generation.
  - Designed and implemented P4 codes and control planes for network applications (Firewall and Load Balancer) in Software Switch, FPGA, and ASIC.

- **Research Engineer**  
  *System Negar Sayna, Iran*  
  Sept 2017 – May 2022  
  - Developed and tested intelligent software for data analysis using C++, Python, NumPy, and Pandas.
  - Worked on software to analyze news and select articles according to user preferences using ML techniques with Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

- **Research Assistant**  
  *Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany*  
  May 2020 – Sep 2020  
  - Optimized multi-core processor performance under temperature constraints and improved ML-based models for application performance prediction.
  - Improved and debugged the HotSniper simulator for Splash-2 benchmarks using C/C++.
  - Analyzed power, IPS, and CPI, and visualized data with Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib).

## Projects
- Created a Mutex and condition variables for the producer-consumer problem using C and Pthreads.
- Detected P2P botnets by discovering flow dependency in C&C traffic using Python and Scapy.
- Developed a WAV player in C for ARM Keil and implemented it on the STM32F4 Discovery board.
- Implemented the AES/DES algorithm in C and VHDL to enhance hardware security.
- Installed and configured dependencies for specific packages and modified GCC for compiling in Scientific Linux.
- Compared the performance of NoSQL data models for Big Data and analyzed different software architectures like REST and SOAP.

## Volunteer Experience
- **Instructor**  
  *Iran University of Science and Technology*  
  - Taught programming languages, English, and mathematics to students.
